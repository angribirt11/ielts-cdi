    <strong>Full Transcript (0:00) You will hear a telephone conversation between a woman who is moving to London and an employee of a relocation service. (0:11) First you have some time to look at questions 1 to 7. Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 7. (1:02) London Relocation Services, Daniel speaking. How may I help you? (1:06) Good morning.
My family and I are moving to London later this year and I wonder if you can help? (1:13) Sure. First of all, I'll need to get some personal details. May I take your full name please? (1:20) It's Anna Woods.
(1:22) Thanks. Where are you moving from? (1:25) Northern Ireland, just outside Belfast actually. (1:29) Right.
And what's your current address? (1:32) It's 118 Fordyce Park. I'll spell that for you. It's F-O-R-D-Y-C-E.
And that's in Ballysalem. (1:46) And what's the postcode? (1:49) It's B-T-14-9-B-J. (1:53) Alright.
And could I take a contact phone number? (1:57) I'll give you my mobile number as you can get me on that any time. It's 078400-51963. (2:10) Great.
Got that. Now we always like to get a bit more information about the families that we're moving. It helps with the search.
Are you moving for work? (2:21) Yes. My husband's just got a new job in London. (2:24) And what about you? Do you work? (2:27) Well, I've been working as a teaching assistant recently, but I'm actually a qualified nurse and I'd like to get back into that if possible.
(2:36) Right. And do you have any children? (2:39) Yes, a son. So we need to find a school for him.
(2:43) Is it a secondary school you'll be looking for? (2:46) No, he's still in primary school. He's not quite at the secondary level yet. (2:50) Right.
Fine. So, let's go on to talk about your requirements for the property. Do you have a preferred location? Is your husband's job in the centre? (3:01) No, it's in East London, but we'd rather live somewhere quieter.
(3:06) Sure. There are some lovely areas in the south. (3:09) Okay, that sounds great.
Now, my husband doesn't want to spend too long commuting to work every day. (3:16) So, I imagine that ideally he'd like to be not too far from a station then? (3:23) Yes. He drives now, but I guess that's not going to be possible and he's not keen on buses.
(3:29) What about you or your son? Do you have any preferences? Does your son do any sport, for example? (3:36) He's quite active, so I'm sure he'd love a park nearby to run around in. He doesn't do swimming or anything like that. (3:44) Great.
Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 8 to 10. Now listen and answer questions 8 to 10. (4:19) So, what sort of property do you have in mind? (4:23) We have friends who live in an amazing flat over there, but as we've always lived in a house, I think we'll stick with that.
We'd find it hard to adapt to a flat. (4:33) Okay. And size-wise, how many bedrooms would you like? (4:38) Well, there's just myself, my husband and our son.
(4:42) So, you definitely need a two-bedroom property. But how about having a guest room? I might be able to find a three-bedroom property for you. (4:51) Yes, that would be ideal.
We're sure to have family visiting often. (4:56) Alright. I've made a note of that.
Now, are there any other requirements for your new property? (5:02) Hmm. Well, it's not essential, but it'd be handy to have an office for when my husband works from home. It doesn't need to be a big one.
I guess it all comes down to budget. (5:15) Yes. Okay, Anna.
Well, I've certainly got enough to be getting on with, and I... (5:24) That is the end of Part 1. You now have one minute to check your answers to Part 1. (5:32) Part 2 (5:33) You will hear a radio show host interviewing a man called Michael McKay, who is the director of a Canadian theatre. (5:44) First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 14. Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 14.
(6:31) Michael McKay, the executive director of the Canadiana Festival Theatre, is here with us to talk about the season starting in June. Welcome! (6:41) Thank you. We have an amazing season this year with some great deals for our clients.
(6:48) You know, we have a lot of regular theatre goers who will be happy to know that we have some great specials for the upcoming season. (6:57) For example, if you order two tickets to any play performed at the theatre, you can get 50% off the price of the next play we put on. (7:07) This replaces the special offer we had last season, which was for 50% off all performances on Mondays.
(7:17) It is good to get youth interested in theatre, so many schools arrange class trips to our theatre. (7:24) This year we will send a special study guide to each class so the students can familiarize themselves with the play beforehand. (7:33) Having some background information always makes the experience of watching the actors perform the play more enjoyable.
(7:43) Each guide has suggestions for classroom discussion after seeing the show, which teachers find useful for a follow-up activity. (7:54) Also, we mustn't forget the Bring a Friend special for our senior citizens. (7:59) On Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, everyone over 60 can buy one ticket and get one free.
(8:06) The offer includes all the musicals plus the plays, so there is lots of choice. (8:14) We also include $5 off any gift shop purchase for those clients who spend more than $30 there. (8:22) So, what would you say is the best play you have this year? (8:27) Ha! All the plays are great, but the must-see play is called Something to Say.
(8:34) It stars the amazing actor Christopher Plunkett. (8:39) This likely will be the last year we see him perform, as he has been on stage for over 60 years. (8:47) Actually, for the first time, he helped write this play, and it really is a commentary on his amazing career as an actor.
(8:59) You may have seen him in supporting roles in movies, but acting on stage is his first love. (9:06) He has been in so many fantastic dramas, I can't think of him ever not being on stage. (9:16) Before you hear the rest of the interview, you have some time to look at questions 15 to 20.
(9:57) Now listen and answer questions 15 to 20. (10:05) Now, let's talk about the season's musicals. (10:09) The first one is called The Climb.
(10:12) Of course, the best part is that we have that really amazing singer, Justin McDonald, playing the part of the hero. (10:19) It is an inspiring story of a man called Stephen, who starts working for a newspaper in a very junior job in the mailroom. (10:30) After many years and many promotions, he finally gets to the top position.
(10:36) He becomes editor-in-chief of the newspaper. (10:41) Then we have that wonderful classic that we show every two years because it is so popular, The Voyagers. (10:48) It is a wonderful story of a Canadian farming family in the late 1800s and how they settled their land near Kingston, Ontario.
(10:59) The musical gives a good description of the times, the struggles, and the way of life in that period. (11:07) The next musical, Joey Brown, is a comical story of a piano player who writes songs for kids' TV shows. (11:16) However, he ends up having a terrible time when he gets a new boss who always criticizes him and makes his life difficult.
(11:27) Poor Joey has to learn how to win over the boss. (11:31) The show has a couple of funny twists and a surprise ending. (11:36) In Main Street, Karen Hines stars in the true story of a young woman whose dream is to compete in the Olympics.
(11:44) She is such a powerful actress in this role. (11:49) It is about a gymnast who is crushed when, during a practice session, she breaks her ankle just one week before the Games. (11:59) Now for Millie and Mike.
(12:01) What a story this is. (12:04) Stephanie James and Peter Dumas are only ten years old, but they star in the musical as the twins Millie and Mike. (12:12) They have a wonderful upbringing with their grandmother who teaches them life's lessons through song.
(12:20) The final must-see is so whimsical. (12:24) In Windswept, a land of imaginary creatures, the flowers and trees dance and the enchanted animals talk. (12:33) It is delightful.
(12:35) And we even have a very talented actor who is amazing as he travels with us through the world of make-believe. (12:43) Kids love this one. (12:46) The music is fun and their imagination goes wild.
(12:51) Michael, that all sounds wonderful. (12:54) Now tell me about the restaurants in the theater district. (13:01) That is the end of Part 2. (13:03) You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 2. (13:09) Part 3 (13:11) You will hear an engineering student called Kathy discussing a piece of work with her tutor.
(13:19) First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 26. (14:14) Now listen carefully and answer questions 21 to 26. (14:23) Hello, Kathy.
How's your dissertation on water pumps going? (14:27) Not too bad, thanks. (14:29) I'm getting on well with the literature review now and my lab work's fine so far. (14:35) Oh, that's good.
(14:36) Remember, you should aim to have your results section completed by the end of next month, (14:41) so there's plenty of time to finalise the whole thing by the summer deadline. (14:46) Anyway, looks like you're on track. (14:49) I've been through your first chapter now and I was quite impressed.
(14:52) Oh, that's a relief. (14:54) Sometimes your sentences are a little long and over-complex, (14:59) but the overall structure of the piece is very clear. (15:03) I'd recommend you get a critical friend to go through it with you.
(15:07) Then, once you've built in citations of other work in the field, I think it'll be pretty good. (15:13) Oh, thanks. I was pleased I decided to focus on water pumps.
(15:18) You seem to be testing an appropriate range of pump design. (15:23) Lots of students make the mistake of either restricting their range too much (15:28) or, conversely, not narrowing it down enough. (15:31) You've managed to avoid those twin traps.
(15:35) However, I think you'd get more convincing results if you took some additional measurements. (15:41) I've noted exactly what I mean on your work. (15:43) Yes, I thought that might be necessary.
(15:46) And I know I need to get down to some more library work too. (15:50) Well, I don't think that's essential at the moment. (15:53) Oh, right.
So, what do you suggest I do next? (15:58) Repeat my last experiment using different variables? (16:03) Well, you could have a word with James Higgins tomorrow. (16:07) He's coming here to give a lecture on hydraulics to the faculty (16:10) and it would be a great chance to have a chat with him. (16:15) Especially as your experimental work has drawn so heavily from his last article in the British Engineering Journal.
(16:22) Oh, fantastic! (16:23) And you never know how successful a chat with him might turn out to be. (16:28) I got my first research post when I was a final year student (16:32) and asked a visiting professor to explain what he meant in some article he'd written. (16:37) So I urge all my students to take any such opportunity that arises.
(16:43) But times have changed. (16:45) People like that are too busy to talk to mere students these days. (16:49) I don't know about that.
(16:51) Anyway, is there anything else I can help with? (16:54) Any practical information about layout, perhaps? (16:57) Well, I suppose I'm a bit unsure about how the bibliography should be presented. (17:04) Mind you, I can just check what's normally done in journal articles, (17:09) so that's not something to bother you with. (17:11) I'd welcome some guidance, though, about what I should or shouldn't include in the appendices.
(17:18) I know some things, some of my data tables or details of specs perhaps, (17:25) are not really needed in the main body of the text and I'm likely to be pushed for words there. (17:30) OK, I can certainly help you with that. (17:34) But it will take a while, so can we deal with that next week? (17:38) I've got that solar panel seminar to go into in a few minutes.
(17:42) There's plenty of work you can be carrying on with in the meantime. (17:45) Sure, that's no problem. (17:48) I think I'll go and investigate the latest version of the CAD software (17:52) to see if it might help with my pump design experiments at all.
(17:59) Before you hear the rest of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 27 to 30. (18:29) Now listen and answer questions 27 to 30. (18:37) Before you go, though, I'd like quickly to run through what you should be doing over the next few months, (18:43) not just for your dissertation, but also to help your chances of getting the research post you'd like.
(18:49) Is that OK with you? (18:51) Yes, that would be really helpful. (18:52) Well, you certainly need to become a member of the Mechanical Engineers Society, (18:58) and then you'll be able to go along to their meetings. (19:02) There, you must make a point of making yourself known to various people, like Professor Jones.
(19:08) He's the current president and is very approachable. (19:12) OK, so I could do some networking there. (19:15) Exactly.
Also, I think you should try to set up some visits to industry. (19:20) Go to a lot of different workplaces just to see how things are done. (19:25) It's actually a very good way of making sure you're familiar with the cutting edge of what's going on.
(19:32) Textbooks, even academic articles, sometimes lag behind industry. (19:38) That sounds really interesting. (19:40) Also, I'd love the chance to do a bit of work abroad for a while.
(19:44) Well, that's actually the next thing I was going to recommend. (19:47) I'm sure we could set up a month for you in either the States or Canada, (19:52) and that would be a great way to find out how things are done elsewhere. (19:57) That'd be good.
Thank you. (19:59) And the last thing I was going to suggest was that you could go to the European Water Engineering Conference (20:05) being held in Spain in May. (20:07) I could even present my dissertation there.
(20:10) Yes. (20:11) Oh, thank you so much. That's all really helpful.
(20:14) Good. (20:19) That is the end of Part 3. (20:22) You now have 30 seconds to check your answers to Part 3. (20:32) Part 4. (20:34) You will hear part of a lecture given to students in a food science department about safety standards. (20:42) First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.
(21:41) Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40. (21:49) Good morning, everyone. (21:52) In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about food safety (21:56) and the factors involved in setting standards for the food industry (22:01) with particular reference to the situation here in Australia.
(22:06) Now, before anyone can decide what kind of standards need to be set (22:12) for ensuring that any specific food product is safe, (22:16) scientists have to carry out a risk assessment. (22:21) And in doing this, they have to consider several potential problems. (22:27) Firstly, they have to consider the ingredients of the product.
(22:32) They have to decide whether any of these might make the finished product more susceptible to harmful bacteria. (22:42) Then, they have to consider the process used in the preparation of the food (22:47) and whether or not it includes a step designed to eliminate unwanted microorganisms. (22:55) After that, they've got to consider the way products are stored.
(23:01) For instance, in warehouses or cold stores and distributed to retailers. (23:07) And it doesn't end there. (23:09) The analysts even have to be aware of problems that might occur after the food has reached the supermarket.
(23:18) Things like frozen foods being defrosted and then refrozen because the temperature fluctuated (23:25) or foods being kept past their expiry date. (23:30) And finally, any assessment of the overall risk has to take into account (23:36) the way the end users, consumers, normally handle food at home. (23:42) So, as you see, the risk assessment is quite complicated.
(23:53) Now, there are several factors affecting what kind of food we eat. (23:58) Only one of which is legislation. (24:01) Another is the attitudes of consumers.
(24:04) A good example of this is the dislike that many Australians have for additives in their food, (24:12) even when these additives are considered safe (24:15) and without them products have a shorter shelf life or a substandard appearance. (24:21) This has led to the phenomenal expansion of the market for organic food in Australia. (24:28) Another important influence on what we eat is the food industry itself.
(24:35) In some large supermarkets, low prices are the main strategy for attracting customers, (24:41) while for more upscale marketers, image is more important. (24:46) But we should bear in mind, for all of them, the key consideration is profitability. (24:54) Finally, there is the influence of the mass media, (24:58) which is the most important source of information for most people.
(25:03) Unfortunately, this has a rather negative effect, (25:08) because, in general, they are not very objective. (25:12) For one thing, the prime motivation of the media, as with the food industry, is sales. (25:18) And this has a major influence on the way in which the topic is dealt with.
(25:24) A further problem is that news is regarded as a type of entertainment. (25:30) Often, the issues that get a top billing are those that are sensational or controversial. (25:36) So it's not at all surprising if the public ends up with a rather distorted understanding of food and food safety.
(25:46) On top of that, up till now, food safety and nutrition have never been considered a really interesting topic for the public. (25:56) Very few TV or radio shows address the issues, (26:00) and even those shows that are devoted to cooking or eating generally ignore them. (26:06) At this point, I'll just offer a personal opinion on this subject of food safety.
(26:12) I firmly believe in food safety education, starting at primary schools. (26:21) We know that many children who have been taught about the benefits of exercise (26:26) come home and lecture their parents about it. (26:30) So, the same could be done for food and food preparation.
(26:35) And at the same time, the countless educational television shows... (26:47) You now have one minute to check your answers to Part 4. (27:58) That is the end of the listening test. (28:00) You now have ten minutes to transfer your answers to the listening answer sheet. (28:16) That is the end of Section 4. (28:19) You now have two minutes to check your answers.</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Food Safety Standards</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Risk assessment</strong><br>
        Scientists have to consider potential problems with:<br>
        • the product's <span class="blank" contenteditable="true" id="q31"></span> (could they attract harmful bacteria?)<br>
        • method of preparation (will it eliminate harmful micro-organisms?)<br>

        <strong>Factors affecting food consumption</strong><br>
